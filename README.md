# Agglomerative Clustering Tasks

## Task A
1. **Objective:** Utilize the built-in Agglomerative Clustering algorithm to cluster the given data.
   - **Features to Use:** 
     - Annual Income
     - Spending Score
   - **Steps to Follow:**
     1. Import the necessary libraries (e.g., `sklearn` for Agglomerative Clustering).
     2. Load the given dataset.
     3. Extract the `Annual Income` and `Spending Score` features.
     4. Apply the built-in Agglomerative Clustering algorithm.
     5. Visualize the resulting clusters (e.g., using scatter plots).

## Task B
1. **Objective:** Implement a custom Agglomerative Clustering algorithm from scratch.
   - **Features to Use:**
     - Annual Income
     - Spending Score
   - **Steps to Follow:**
     1. Load the given dataset.
     2. Extract the `Annual Income` and `Spending Score` features.
     3. Initialize each data point as its own cluster.
     4. Iteratively merge the two closest clusters based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
     5. Continue until the desired number of clusters is reached or until a stopping criterion is met.
     6. Visualize the resulting clusters (e.g., using scatter plots).

## Notes
- Ensure proper data preprocessing before applying clustering.
- Compare the results of the built-in implementation with your custom implementation.
- Highlight the differences in performance, accuracy, or results (if applicable).
